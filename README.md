# LifeStealers
## Currently listed below is the PLANNED stuff, as these things are NOT implemented
 A lifesteal Plugin for 1.21+, this plugin is primarily developed for Epic Labaratory MC but it is a public resource.

 This plugin features the Lifesteal SMP features,
 The Ability to manufacture Heart Pieces into Hearts, This allows users to gain hearts easily
 Aswell as the ability to make a beyond default hearts via "Golden Hearts" this takes 9 Hearts in a crafting table to combine into one Golden Heart as this are harder to get thats why they seem more broken


 All features can be disabled in config and editted in config
 For now recipes cannot be editted

 Commands for Admins:
 /LifeStealers grant %player% <heart/goldenheart> %amount% // grants heart(s)/golden heart(s) to any user
 /LifeStealers remove %player% <heart/goldenheart> %amount% // removes heart(s)/golden hearts(s) from any user
 /LifeStealers reload // reloads config files 
 /LifeStealers hearts %player% // this shows any players current hearts
 
 Placeholders:
%Lifestealerskillamount% shows how many kills the player has
%LifestealersDeathamount% shows how many deaths the player has
%LifestealersHeartamount% shows the players current heart count
